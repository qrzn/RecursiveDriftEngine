# Recursive Drift Engine

A mystical simulation system with procedural narrative generation, entropy mechanics, and multi-dimensional storytelling.

## Features

- **Drift Field Manipulation**: Fork and collapse nodes in a mystical glyph-based field
- **Entropy Mechanics**: Dynamic entropy system affecting all operations
- **Procedural Narratives**: AI-powered story generation that evolves based on your actions
- **Multiple Timelines**: Actions can create branching timelines with cross-dimensional effects
- **Character Emergence**: Mystical entities that appear based on your choices
- **Drift Enclaves**: Explore different mystical zones with unique properties
- **Resource Management**: Collect Time Salt and Identity Fragments
- **Oracle System**: Receive mystical prophecies about future events

## Quick Start

### Method 1: Simple Launcher (Recommended)
```bash
python3 run.py
```

### Method 2: Direct Terminal Interface
```bash
python3 simple_main.py
```

## Commands

- `scan` - Scan the drift field for new glyph patterns
- `fork` - Create a forked node (increases entropy, generates resources)
- `collapse` - Collapse a node (decreases entropy, more rewards)  
- `wipe` - Memory wipe (resets entropy, creates new timeline)
- `enclave <void|entropy|crystal>` - Travel between mystical enclaves
- `status` - View current system status and resources
- `prophecy` - Generate mystical prophecy about the drift field
- `story` - View recent narrative threads from your timeline
- `timeline` - Show information about all active timelines
- `help` - Display all available commands
- `quit` - Exit the drift field

## Procedural Narrative System

The engine creates evolving stories based on your actions:

- **Timeline Creation**: Major events like memory wipes create new timeline branches
- **Character Emergence**: Mystical entities appear based on entropy levels and actions
- **Cross-Timeline Events**: Actions in one timeline can affect others
- **Thematic Evolution**: Each timeline develops unique narrative themes
- **Dynamic Storytelling**: Stories adapt to your play style and choices

## Optional: AI-Powered Prophecies

For enhanced oracle prophecies, you can add an OpenAI API key:

1. Get an API key from platform.openai.com
2. Set environment variable: `export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here`
3. The oracle system will generate more sophisticated predictions

The system works fully without an API key using local prophecy generation.

## System Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- No external dependencies required for basic functionality
- Optional: OpenAI API key for enhanced prophecies

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter import errors or dependency issues:

1. Make sure you're running from the project root directory
2. Use `python3 run.py` instead of `python3 main.py`
3. The terminal interface (`simple_main.py`) is the stable version

## Game Mechanics

### Entropy System
- Low entropy (< 0.3): Stable, crystalline patterns, predictable outcomes
- Balanced entropy (0.3-0.7): Dynamic equilibrium, varied possibilities  
- High entropy (> 0.7): Chaotic energy, unpredictable but powerful effects

### Resource Generation
- **Time Salt**: Universal currency, generated by all operations
- **Identity Fragments**: Rare resource from complex operations
- **Glyph Patterns**: Visual representation of the current drift state

### Enclaves
- **Void Nexus**: Neutral starting point, balanced entropy effects
- **Entropy Gardens**: Chaotic zone, increases entropy but enhances growth
- **Crystal Sanctum**: Ordered realm, stabilizes entropy and preserves memory

Enjoy exploring the infinite possibilities of the drift field!
